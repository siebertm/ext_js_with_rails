ExtJSWithRails
==============

ExtJSWithRails is a Rails Plugin that tries to ease the creation of ExtJS (http://www.extjs.com/) applications. It includes various little Helpers:
* a generator to create the skeleton of an ExtJS application
* extensions to Models and Controllers
* utilities to distribute JavaScript code over many files and combine them in one file
* integration of JSLint Javascript Syntax checker and yuicompress JS compressor (both require Java!)
* rake tasks to build and check the produced JavaScript files
* a script to call these tasks automatically (like autotest but without testing)
* growl integration
